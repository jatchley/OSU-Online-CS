        <h5>
			This guide will show you how to leverage an existing Twitter API library to make custom POST and GET calls for unsupported functionaliy
		</h5>

        <h3>
			What You'll Need 
		</h3>
		<p> 
			Knowledge of Javascript, Node, NPM, and a willingness to learn! The Twitter API library we'll be using is quite comprehensive, and Twitter makes it very easy to get authorized and up and running quickly to start making cool apps.
			Luckily for us, that means very low overhead and we can get started right away!
		</p>
        
		<h3>
			What You'll Make
		</h3>
		<p>
			When you're finished, you'll have extended the existing functionality of a powerful and easy-to-use library to make a more customized app. If your code is polished enough, you could even
			make a pull request to the library's GitHub page and see if the authors will incorporate it into their library for others to use!
		</p>
		
		<h3>
			Why Do This?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Learning to use the Twitter API is something that is relatively easy to grasp on a basic level, so it's a great starting point for exploring more intermediate and advanced topics. Because it is 
			based on an extremely popular social media website, it is also not hard to think of potential applications for the API on your site. Also, open source software is something that is used by companies
			small and large, amateur programmers, and people all over the world. Contributing to its development and maintenance can be very rewarding, and it also further integrates you into the greater software development community.
