			Possibilities for future efforts

        <p> 
			So with this very basic foundation in place, what else could we do with our application? We could certainly clean up some of our functionality, include it in the Twitter JS Client library we downloaded, and submit a pull request to the 
			creators of that library to see if we could get them to include our changes so everyone could take advantage of them. One first step might be to look at how the other functions of the library are structured and modify our methods 
			to follow a similar standard. We could also add some more generic parameters, error handling, or more helper functions.
			</br>
			</br>
			Another route you could take would be to use the custom POST function that the library includes to figure out how to actually send direct messages to a user. One interesting thing to do might be to figure out how to 
			send automated replies to a message when it is received. Try it out and see how far you can get!
